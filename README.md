# Milestone-Project-Hangman
Hangman Game

Inspiration:
This game is inspired by demonstrating what I have learned so far with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Helping me pass this milestone in my career to learning to become a Software Developer.

Rules:
The rules are simple! We will be trying to figure out what the sentence is, but be mindful... Each letter we get wrong, it brings the Hangmans' demise! Happy guessing.
